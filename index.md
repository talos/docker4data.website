## Open data is great

But...

* Portal tools don't do what you want
* You need to chase down multiple datasets to do real analysis
* Stitching them back together takes time and research

## Meet Docker4Data

Inspired by and leveraging the [Docker][] container ecosystem, Docker4Data can
provide the data you need, nicely packaged and ready to use:

  [Docker]: https://www.docker.com/

* Relational database prepopulated and ready-to-go
* A slim front-end with canned queries and data visualization

### Up and running in &lt; 10 min

Docker4Data is in __alpha__ right now as we experiment and validate the
concept.  A single dataset, comprising all of New York City's mortgages and
deed transfers going back to 1966, including geographic data.

You can [try out][] a shared instance right now.  You can [run your own][] in
less than ten minutes.

  [try out]: /try-it
  [run your own]: /docs

Ever tried to download a big dataset from an open data portal?

Ever tried to figure out how to actually use that dataset?

Ever tried to determine how that dataset relates to others on that portal?
