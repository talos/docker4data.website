## Open data is great.

But...

* Portal tools don't do what you want
* You need to chase down multiple datasets to do real analysis
* Stitching them back together takes time and research

## Meet Docker4Data

Inspired by and leveraging the [Docker][] container ecosystem, Docker4Data can
provide the data you need, nicely packaged and ready to use:

  [Docker]: https://www.docker.com/

* Relational database prepopulated and ready-to-go
* A slim front-end with canned queries and data visualization

### Up and running in &lt; 10 min

Docker4Data is in __alpha__ right now as we experiment and validate the
concept.  A single dataset, comprising all of New York City's mortgages and
deed transfers going back to 1966, including geographic data.

You can [try out][] a shared instance right now.  You can [run your own][] in
less than ten minutes.

  [try out]: /try-it
  [run your own]: /docs

Ever tried to figure out how to actually use that dataset?

Ever tried to determine how that dataset relates to others on that portal?
